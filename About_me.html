             <p class="main_content">Hi. Iam Shashank. Iam pursuing my masters in computer science at Pace University. I completed my undergrad in the field of Civil Engineering but the interest towards computers gave me a desire to learn and pursue my career in the field of computers. I hope my completing this degree I will be competent enough to build software and digital products with cutting edge technologies and build my career in it. Iam currently working on my existing skills and constantly looking forward to update my skills in web development frameworks. </p>
             <p class="main_content">I worked as a customer support associate in amazon india for a period of siz months and then worked in TCS for 1 year  as associate system engineer trainee. I love travelling but have never got a chance to travel much in my past. But after coming to the United States I visited a handfull of places. Moreover, exploring this city on my own is teaching me a whole lot of new experiences which will definitely add memories in my life. I would also like to unfold myself to new heights and explore the world with a more bigger picture. For this first I need to be financially stable so that I can plan my trips with ease. Iam not a lifelong hardworking person. Hence, I would like to work hard in the initial stages of my life and enjoy the later part of my life by doing things which I really have interest in. I love starting my own company in which I can take care of the whole business part of it by recruiting people. So I would mostly be looking to come up with an innovative idea which will revolutionise the world and make a difference. So lets hope for the best! </p><br>
