            <h1>Hello  World!</h1>
            <p class="firstp">Iam taking 3 classes in this semester. They are :<br>1) Concepts and Structures in Internet Computing.<br>2) Algorithms and Computing Theory<br>3) Database Management and Concepts</p><br>
            <p class="exp">My favourite class among these 3 is "Concepts and Structures in Internet Computing. This is because Iam already interested in web development and this course consists of web development related content. Since I only have skills in front end web development untill now, this course will help me become a full stack developer. Also the way in professor teaches this course does not let me get bored unlike in other courses like in algorithms the professor just puts on the videos and asks us to see it. Even in the class of DBMS, my professor narrates the lecture so slowly that the sleep becomes unavoidable. Coming to the assignments the assignments in the class of Intenet computing are in such a way that no student in the class can copy it from any source, but instead we have to have an understanding of it in order to complete it. This lets every student learn and only then do the assignment and submit its proofs by taking screenshots or screencasting. I hope the course curriculum advances soon and I get to become proficient in building modern day full stack web applications which I can proudly put on my resume. </p><br>
